    """A vectorized dual iso-surface extraction algorithm for signed distance fields.

    This implementation approximates the relaxation based vertex placement
    method of [1] using a `naive` [2] average. This method is fully vectorized.

    This method does not compute surface normals, see `surfacenets.normals`
    for details.

    Params:
        node: the root node of the SDF. If you already have discretized SDF values in
            grid like fashion, wrap them using sdfs.Discretized.
        grid: (I,J,K) spatial sampling locations
        edge_strategy: Defines how edge/surface boundary intersection are determined.
            If not specified defaults to LinearEdgeStrategy.
        vertex_strategy: Defines how vertices are placed inside of voxels. If not
            specified defaults to NaiveSurfaceNetVertexStrategy.
        triangulate: When true, returns triangles instead of quadliterals.
        vertex_relaxation_percent: Edge intersection values outside of [0,1) will
            be tolerated up to this percentage. Increasing this value allows for
            more accurate shapes when the resolution of the grid is low and multiple
            vertices per cell are required.
        return_debug_info: Whether to return additional intermediate results

    Returns:
        verts: (N,3) array of vertices
        faces: (M,F) index array of faces into vertices. For quadliterals F is 4,
            otherwise 3.
        debug: instance of DebugInfo when return_debug_info is True.
